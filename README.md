# Python Assessment 1 - Wednesday 22nd July 2020

This repository contains the answers to the Python Assessment 1, taken at the QA Academy on Wednesday 22nd July 2020. In retrospect after 4 years and since Python 3.6, I would love to go back and re-author this assessment with the knowledge I've built up since.
